    <p id="tribute-info" class="tribute-info">One of the most important figures to emerge in the 1960s, Dylan was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota. he rose to prominence in the folk scene thanks to his lyrics, full of pointed political commentary, but his subsequent willingness to experiment with electrical instruments, opposed to the acoustic approach of folk music, was more than once compared to the controversy generated by the premiere of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. Even so, his output from the mid-60s (from 1964's <em>The Times Are A'Changin'</em> to 1966's <em>Blonde on Blonde</em>) has been highly rated by critics.
